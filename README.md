An example micro-site used in [ES6 workshop](https://slides.com/schalkventer/what-the-es6) to show how ES6 can be used in production.

## Overview

### Endpoint
- Consumes [custom endpoint](https://8p6o1pcool.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/default/people-in-space) on the client-side.
- Endpoint uses AWS Lambda behind the scenes to repurpose `https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/` into a simpler format that is publicly accesible (by strippping CORS and authentication).

### Branches
- There are two branches in the repository: `master` and `tranpilation`.
- `master` serves as an example of how native ES modules can be used in production without transpilation.
- `transpilation` serves as an example how [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) can be used to transpile and deploy ES6 code [to Netlify](https://humans-in-space.netlify.com/).
